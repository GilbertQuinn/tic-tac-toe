## How to Play

1. Player **X** always goes first.
2. Click any empty square to place your mark.
3. The first player to get **3 in a row** (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
4. If all 9 squares are filled with no winner, the game is a **draw**.
5. Use **New Game** to play another round (scores are kept).
6. Use **Reset Scores** to zero out the scoreboard.
7. Click any entry in **Move History** to jump back (or forward) to that point in the game.
